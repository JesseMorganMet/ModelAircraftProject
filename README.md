## Description

The members of a Model Aircraft Club require an application that allows them to see specific weather data across three locations in order to visually see if the weather is suitable to fly their model aircrafts at their club locations

### Key Requirements checklist; 

- [ ] Select the specific club locations; Capel Curig, Rhyl, Aberporth  


- [ ] Suggestions whether the weather is suitable for most aircrafts, eg; wind speed less than 10mph, precipitation probability less then 20% and visibility is good then the suggestion is represented with “GO” flying is possible  


- [ ] Weather data visible for customers with more bespoke +/ customized aircrafts can decide for themselves. Weather data; Wind speed, Precipitation probability, Visibility  


- [ ] Select future times as most club members have to work around job times and might be working on plans hours from their checking time  


- [ ] Responsiveness so that it will work on both mobiles and computers for members without smartphones  


- [ ] Enter specific model aircraft weather requirements so the suggestions are unique/dynamic to each plane  


- [ ] “Save” unique plane requirements for ease of access in the future
